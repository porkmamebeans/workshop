# \#01 Induction/Navigation/Resource



## Induction 

Check if Revit 2021 is installed, and open it.

![Table-like Template.](../../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

Select random Family template. \(in this workshop, the table-like template above will be used unless otherwise instructed.\)

Open Dynamo from Manage &gt; Visual Programming.

 Open `Basics_Basic02.dyn` from the samples list at right bottom corner.

## Navigation

Once `Basics_Basic02.dyn` is opened, you must be able to see a set of components wired up called "Node", which stores values and data.

**Drag MMB** \(Middle Mouse Button\) for **panning view.**

There are two modes of navigation in Dynamo:

* Graph View Navigation
* Background 3D View Navigation

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%287%29%20%281%29.png)

You can switch between these two mode by clicking buttons at right top corner. 

Please switch to Background 3D View Navigation.

Nodes have turned transparent, and now you are able to play around with 3D viewport.

Also **drag MMB** for **panning view**, and **drag RMB** \(Right Mouse Button\) for **rotating view**.

Switch back to Graph View Navigation.

{% hint style="info" %}
While holding esc. key, you can switch the navigation modes temporarily.
{% endhint %}

![3D Preview also appears in Revit window.](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%286%29.png)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Keep an eye on three windows: two navigation modes and Revit window. 
{% endhint %}
